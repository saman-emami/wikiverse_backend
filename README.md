This repository houses the backend API for Wikiverse, a collaborative wiki website built with Django and Django REST Framework. The frontend, managed in a separate repository (link: https://github.com/saman-emami/wikiverse_frontend), leverages this API to provide various functionalities, including:
* User authentication and management
* Article creation, editing, and retrieval

## Key Technologies:

* Python
* Django
* Django REST Framework
* PostgreSQL (database)
* JWT (authentication)

## Contribution
